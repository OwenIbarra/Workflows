.SYNOPSIS
    Adds or removes a shared network printer for all user profiles on this computer as a per computer connection.
.DESCRIPTION
    Adds or removes a shared network printer for all user profiles on this computer as a per computer connection.
.EXAMPLE
    -PrinterSharePath '\\SRV22-DC1-TEST\Brother HL-L2395DW series'

    Verifying that the print server 'SRV22-DC1-TEST' is reachable via ping.
    Print server 'SRV22-DC1-TEST' is reachable.
    Verifying '\\SRV22-DC1-TEST\Brother HL-L2395DW series' is a valid printer share.
    Adding the printer '\\SRV22-DC1-TEST\Brother HL-L2395DW series' to the system account.
    Attempting to add the printer for all users.
    Retrieving the printer driver.
    Installing the printer driver.
    Printer driver installed.
    Restarting the print spooler.
    The printer has been successfully added.

PARAMETER: -PrinterSharePath '\\REPLACE-ME\My Printer Share'
    Specify the path to the Windows server printer share you would like to add for all users on this computer. E.g., '\\PRNT-SRV\My Printer Share'.

PARAMETER: -Remove
    Removes the printer from this computer instead of adding it.

PARAMETER: -Restart
